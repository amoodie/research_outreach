This module utilizes a Matlab Runtime Compiled program for backend calculations and plotting of the model results.
The module is to be run as a standalone application, and can be downloaded at http://www.coastalsustainability.rice.edu/outreach/.

For help troubleshooting the Matlab executable, please visit https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler.html.
Model parameterization follows Nittrouer et al., 2012 GSAB; the parameters can be viewed in the source code at https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach.

The module was created by Andrew J. Moodie as part of an National Science Foundation funded research project assessing the sustainability of anthropogenically influenced deltas.
The research is supported by Grant No. 1427262 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to A.J.M. under Grant No. 1450681.
