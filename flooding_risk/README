# Installation and setup guides

## Windows (Windows 10)

## Mac (OSX)

## Linux (Ubuntu)
* Visit [https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach/tree/master/flooding_risk/download](https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach/tree/master/flooding_risk/download) and download the 64-bit Linux FloodingModule installer.
* Run the installer by `cd`ing into the download location and running `./FloodingModule_lnx64.install`. Note that you may have to run this as root (i.e., with `sudo`) depending on where you intend to install the program and Matlab MCR.
* Follow the default options. If you must make any changes during the install process, be sure to note them (e.g., the install location), as you will need this information to run the module program.

*\item You can now run the program with `<FloodingModuleRoot>/application/run_FloodingModule.sh <MCRpath>` or, if you followed the default options, `/usr/local/FloodingModule/application/run_FloodingModule.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v92/`.

# Disclaimer

This module utilizes a Matlab Compiled Runtime (MCR) program for backend calculations and plotting of the model results.
The program accompanying this module is to be run as a standalone application, but relies on the Matlab MCR; the program can be be downloaded at \url{http://www.coastalsustainability.rice.edu/outreach/}.
For help troubleshooting the Matlab executable, please visit \url{https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html}.
The source code can be viewed at \url{https://github.com/amoodie/research_outreach}.

The module was created by Andrew J. Moodie as part of an National Science Foundation funded research project assessing the sustainability of anthropogenically influenced deltas.
The research is supported by Grant No. 1427262 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to A.J.M. under Grant No. 1450681.
